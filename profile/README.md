## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - this is where any software developed by the Planet School will live. You will find tutorials, projects at various stages of completion, student creations, and maintained projects that you can contribute to (one day 🤞). You can visit the [Planet School website](https://theplanetschool.org) to learn more or visit our [projects page](https://planetschool.notion.site/).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
